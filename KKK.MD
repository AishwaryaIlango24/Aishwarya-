## Description

This project focuses on optimizing public transport systems by leveraging IoT sensors, Arduino microcontrollers, and Python scripts. It includes functionalities like distance calculation, arrival time estimation, and real-time data transmission for efficient transit management. Additionally, the project integrates with Thingspeak for data visualization and analysis.

## Features

- Real-time location tracking of public transport vehicles.
- Accurate distance calculation between stops.
- Arrival time estimation based on real-time data.
- Integration with Thingspeak for data visualization and analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Arduino IDE
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Python
- Thingspeak

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and configure the project components:

1. *Arduino Code for ESP32 Microcontroller:*

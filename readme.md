Project Overview
The "Public Transportation Enhancement with IoT" project aims to improve the efficiency, reliability, and user experience of public transportation systems through the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. By leveraging real-time data and smart devices, the project focuses on optimizing various aspects of public transport, including route planning, vehicle tracking, passenger information, and operational efficiency.

This readme file provides an overview of the project's objectives, components, design, code samples, and future innovations.

Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Real-time Vehicle Tracking: Implement GPS and IoT sensors on public transport vehicles for accurate real-time location tracking.

Passenger Information Systems: Develop a system to provide passengers with real-time information about bus/train locations, expected arrival times, and any delays through mobile apps, digital displays at stops, or other communication channels.

Occupancy Monitoring: Use sensors to monitor the occupancy of vehicles in real time to optimize routes, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance the passenger experience.

Components and Design
Hardware Implementation
The project uses the following IoT hardware components:

GPS Module: NEO-6M GPS module for positioning and tracking buses based on satellite communication.

ESP32 Microcontroller: A low-cost Wi-Fi module with an in-built microcontroller for data transmission.

Ultrasonic Sensor: Used with Arduino to measure distances for passenger count.

I2C LCD: A 20x4 Character I2C LCD for local display in the bus.

Data Transmission
Data is collected from sensors and transmitted as follows:

From Arduino to Wi-Fi module (ESP32) using AT commands over soft serial UART.

From Wi-Fi module to a real-time transit information platform, ThingSpeak, via HTTP or MQTT.

Arrival Time Calculation
The project calculates arrival times using the Haversine formula for distance and vehicle speed. Here is a sample Python script for arrival time calculation:

python
Copy code
class ArrivalTimeCalculator:
    # ...
    def calculate_arrival_time(self, distance, average_speed):
        # ...
    
    def process_new_coordinates(self, new_coordinate, distance, average_speed):
        # ...
Mobile Application (MIT App Inventor)
The mobile application provides real-time transit information to passengers. It retrieves data from ThingSpeak and displays information such as latitude, longitude, speed, distance, arrival time, and passenger count.
